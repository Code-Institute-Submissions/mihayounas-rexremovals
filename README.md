## Responsiveness Test

* The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) ,I can confirm that all the tests were passed.
## Browser Compatibility

Rex Removals site was tested on the following browsers with no visible issues for the user:
1. Google Chrome 
2. Safari 
3. Mozilla Firefox
* Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of browsers and device sizes. 


## Known Bugs
* ### Resolved
* During the validation process three bugs were found as follows :
1. About Us page - the first section was missing a header, this was eassily fixed by adding the proper header to the section.
2. The closing tag was missing for a h3 ,this was easily fixed but later on I changed the h3 of the section to a h2.
3. CSS - missed a closing bracket .

* ### Unresolved
    * The form,  acts like you would expect it to, it acknowledges your data input, however the data doesn't push anywhere it just takes the user to a thank you page . This is a limitation within this particular project and would be rectified .

    ## Additional Testing
### Lighthouse
The website was tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome Developer Tools to test each of the pages for:
* Performance - How the page will be loading.

* Best Practices 
* SEO - Search Engine Optimisation. This helps us to understand if the website is optimised for search engine result rankings.

The results are as follows:

1. For the Desktop:
